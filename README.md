using
[ProtoStax for Arduino](https://www.protostax.com/products/protostax-for-arduino)
and
[ProtoStax for Breadboard/Custom](https://www.protostax.com/products/protostax-for-breadboard)


## Prerequisites

This demo uses
* [ProtoStax for Arduino](https://www.protostax.com/products/protostax-for-arduino)
* [ProtoStax for Breadboard/Custom](https://www.protostax.com/products/protostax-for-breadboard)
* Arduino (Uno), but you can use other form factors that fit a Shield
* LEDs (Green, Yellow, Red, Orange and White)
* Resistors (220 ohms, 2k ohms)
* Momentary Push button switches

For further instructions, see the [Traffic Light Redux!](https://www.hackster.io/sridhar-rajagopal/traffic-light-redux-70225e) Tutorial at [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/sridhar-rajagopal/traffic-light-redux-70225e)

## Installing

This demo uses the Button library (renamed to JC_Button now) - see [https://github.com/JChristensen/JC_Button](https://github.com/JChristensen/JC_Button)

```
Arduino IDE->Sketch->Include LIbrary->Manage Libraries - choose
JC_Button and install it
git clone https://github.com/protostax/ProtoStax_Traffic_Light.git
```

## Usage

See instructions in Tutorial linked above for putting together the components and
enclosures. 

```
open
ProtoStax_Traffic_Light/ProtoStax_Traffic_Light.ino in
Arduino IDE
compile sketch and upload to your Arduino
```
